# RISC-V-Processor-with-Pipelining
Implementation of the pipelined RISC V processor with many useful features as fully bypassing, dynamic branch prediction, single and multi cycle instructions, ALU unit works in parallel with a multiplication unit, and Reorder Buffer to guarantee in-order termination.
